// Qno 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


var myGuest = ['Sir Zia', 'Sir Zeeshan', 'Sir Daniyal ', 'Sir Adeel', 'Madam Heera'];

for (let i = 0; i < myGuest.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Hi ${myGuest[i]}, You are humbly invited to dinner with me`);
}
